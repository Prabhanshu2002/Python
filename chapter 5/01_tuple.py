# Python tuples are containers to store a set of odered values of any data types and tuples are immutable.
#Creating Tuple using ()
t = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
# t1 = ()  #creating empty tuple
# t2 = (1)   # wrong way to declare a tuple with single element
#t1 = (1,)  # Declare a tuple with single element need a comma(,)

#printing the element of a tuple
# print(t[0])

#can't update the values of a tuple bcz tuples are immutable.
# t[0] = 32
# print(t1)
# print(type(t2))
